Index.php contents: php, html, css, javascript
1. php handles the image generation. 
    -the image generates in a standard 200 x 300 pixels in color
    -can be changed to gray scale and 400 x 600 pixels
2. html, css and javascript is used for the front end
    -the javascript portion is for the radio buttons
        just to uncheck the buttons
    -I did not want to use javascript for any of the image generation, 
        just front end.
3. radio buttons are used to switch to gray, different image ratio or both
